I enjoy speaking about programming and technology. This page lists some of my recent talks, with links to code, slides, and videos. If you'd like me to speak at a meetup or conference, [get in touch](mailto:contact@ankursethi.in)! 

## Build a Simple Data Grid With Angular 2

A 20-minute hands-on talk where I demonstrate how to build a simple data grid component that can handle tens of thousands of rows of data without breaking a sweat. Organized by [Angular-Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/Angular-Bangalore/). **Code**: <https://github.com/s3thi/angular-data-grid-talk>

## Optimizing Browser Performance

This talk was an overview of how me and my colleagues at [Alaris Prime](https://alarisprime.com) helped optimize page load performance on Aditya Birla's [abof.com](http://abof.com). I spoke about some of the major factors that affect time to first paint for a web page, and included a hands-on demonstration of how to use Chrome Developer Tools to discover performance problems. Organized and hosted by the good folks at [Ajency.in](http://ajency.in/) in Goa. 

## React in Depth for JavaScript Developers

In this hands-on workshop, I walked the participants through building a SoundCloud client using React. The workshop was targeted towards experienced developers, so I didn't spend much time on the basics of the library. Instead, we jumped straight into writing code. Organized by Alaris Prime and hosted by [Jaaga](http://jaaga.in/). **Code**: <https://github.com/s3thi/soundcloud-explorer>

## Web Performance Case Study: The Making of abof.com

A talk about how me and me colleagues at Alaris Prime rebuilt Aditya Birla's [abof.com](http://abof.com) from scratch as an isomorphic React application, getting the page load time on 3G connections down from ~20s to less than 3s. Hosted and organized by [HasGeek](https://hasgeek.com) as part of [JSFoo 2016](https://jsfoo.in/2016/). **Video**: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8uMg-VwJS8> **Slides**: <https://speakerdeck.com/s3thi/building-abof-dot-com>
