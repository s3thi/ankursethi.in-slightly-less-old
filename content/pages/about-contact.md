My name is Ankur Sethi. I was born and raised in New Delhi, but I currently live in Bangalore.

I lead the Web Engineering team at [Uncommon](http://uncommon.is), a digital product design agency. When I'm not programming computers, I'm either listening to music, producing music, or writing lyrics to go with something I've produced. I'm equally bad at all of these things.

The easiest and fastest way of getting in touch with me is via email. You can write to me at [contact@ankursethi.in](mailto:contact@ankursethi.in).

I'm active on several social networks and online discussion boards. A few of the more relevant ones are:

  * [Medium](https://medium.com/@ankurs3thi)
