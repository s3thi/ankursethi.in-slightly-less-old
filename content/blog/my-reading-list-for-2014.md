The hardest thing to do after finishing a book is deciding which one you want to read next. Things become harder still when you and your roommates collectively own hundreds of books, most of which have been on your to-read list for years. And if you own an e-reader with even more books on it — you see where I’m going with this, right?

This is why I have made a reading list for this year, and it looks something like this:

*   _The Essence of Camphor_ by Naiyer Masud
*   _Shantaram_ by Gregory David Roberts
*   _Ready Player One_ by Ernest Cline
*   _Sea of Poppies_ by Amitav Ghosh
*   _River of Smoke_ by Amitav Ghosh
*   _The Shadow Lines_ by Amitav Ghosh
*   _In the Miso Soup_ by Ryu Murakami
*   _Coin Locker Babies_ by Ryu Murakami
*   _Almost Transparent Blue_ _Popular Hits of the Showa Era_ by Ryu Murakami
*   _Siddhartha_ by Herman Hesse
*   _Flowers for Algernon_ by Daniel Keyes
*   _Oryx and Crake_ by Margaret Atwood
*   _The Year of the Flood_ by Margaret Atwood
*   _MaddAddam_ by Margaret Atwood
*   _The Handmaid’s Tale_ by Margaret Atwood
*   _The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. Le Guin
*   _The Dispossessed_ by Ursula K. Le Guin
*   _Ghostwritten_ by David Mitchell
*   _number9dream_ by David Mitchell
*   _One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest_ by Ken Kesey
*   _Something Happened_ by Joseph Heller
*   _The Spy Who Came in from the Cold_ by John Le Carré
*   _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_ by John Le Carré
*   _The Honourable Schoolboy_ by John Le Carré
*   _Smiley’s People_ by John Le Carré

Update: Since I couldn’t find an electronic version of Ryu Murakami’s _Almost Transparent Blue_, and the physical version was too expensive in India, I decided to replace it with _Popular Hits of the Showa Era_.
