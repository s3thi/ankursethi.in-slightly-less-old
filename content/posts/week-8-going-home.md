The great thing about the weeknote format is that you can make your note as long or short as you want. I'm keeping it short today, with just a few important life updates.

2018 has been a tough year for me. My mental health is at an all-time low, so I've decided to take a long break from work and go live with my family in Delhi for a while. I'm planning to spend a lot of time cooking, reading, and playing games on my Switch.

By this time every year, I have a long list of new year's resolutions. Last year's list had no less than 20 items. I ended up accomplishing a lot of those goals, but they came at the cost of my health and well-being. I'm going to keep it simple this year and limit my list of resolutions to three or four tiny goals. Top of the list: take care of my health.

My throat is slowly getting better. I expect that I'll be able to talk normally again in a month or two. Reddit tells me I might have something called [Muscle Tension Dysphonia](http://www.otolaryngology.pitt.edu/centers-excellence/voice-center/conditions-we-treat/muscle-tension-dysphonia), but I'll keep the self-diagnosis out of this and just do what my doctor tells me to.

A happy new year to whoever is reading this tonight! Hope you find whatever it is that you're looking for.
