There are three reasons why I don’t like using web browsers for storing my bookmarks. First, browsers make it hard for me to access my bookmarks from my phone or a friend’s computer; second, I find the browsers’ interface for managing bookmarks unwieldy and confusing; and third, I switch between browsers very often, which means I inadvertently have my bookmarks spread out between Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera Mobile and the Android Browser. Web-based bookmarking services are accessible via any Internet-connected computer, have user interfaces that are in line with my personal preferences and are browser agnostic. They alleviate pretty much all the issues I have with browser-based bookmarking.

After thinking about it for longer than I should have, I built my own little bookmarking tool yesterday evening and deployed it to my VPS. It’s a part of [Can ‘O Beans](http://github.com/s3thi/can_o_beans/) and lives behind this [humble bookmarks page](http://ankursethi.in/bookmarks/). It lets me add bookmarks to my collection, assign descriptions and tags to them, and search through my collection by tag or hostname. Next up on my TODO list is a Chrome extension. Also in the works is a better search, an RSS feed, an import/export feature and several UI tweaks.

Building this little tool must have taken me about three hours. Time well spent, I’d say.
